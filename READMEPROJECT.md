An open-source software project that we want to pursue is that of a blockchain-based supply chain management system. The objective of this project is to be able to track products/material as it moves through the supply chain. This is inspired by the supply chain crisis that has been affecting the world since the start of COVID. The idea behind this is to be able to track material, through the use of blockchain verification, as it moves through the supply chain and to cut out the human error that may be involved in much of todayâ€™s supply chain problems. In this project, we will need to design an architecture that considers the following: manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. In addition to this, it would be also very helpful if we could provide a last visited destination and current destination of material within the supply chain. We would use smart contract technology to be able to manage the transfer of the material from one source to another source. In addition to this, we would also develop smart contracts to be able to automate the process of getting material from the manufacturer to the consumer, and provide updates of the material as it is making its way through the supply chain. All in all, our project would focus on the tracking of material through the supply chain and will use smart contracts to be able to track and progress material through the supply chain.
